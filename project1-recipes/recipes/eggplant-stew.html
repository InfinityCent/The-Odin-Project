    </ul>

    <h2>Cooking Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix 6 teaspoons of salt with 3 cups of white basmati rice and soak in water for at least 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Slice 8 eggplants in half length-wise and fry them over canola oil. Flip them over and wait until 
            they have become soft. Remove them and store them in a separate container.</li>
        <li>Chop 1 large onion and fry over some canola oil until they have turned golden. Do this in the same pan
            used for frying eggplants.</li>
        <li>Dice 3 chicken breasts and add them to the onion, cook until they have turned white.</li>
        <li>Boil water and add to the chicken until they are partially submerged.</li>
        <li>Add 2 tablespoons of tomato paste to the chicken, mix until it has spread evenly.</li>
        <li>Add 2 tablespoons of fajita seasoning to the chicken (or more if desired), mix.</li>
        <li>Add salt and pepper, adjust based on preference.</li>
        <li>Put chicken on low simmer until the sauce is slightly viscous.</li>
        <li>Add fried eggplants to the chicken along with any other ingredients of your choice.</li>
        <li>Get a separate pot and fill it with water, put it to boil.</li>
        <li>Pour the rice into a sieve and briefly rinse it, then add boiling water. Wait about 10 minutes until 
            the rice has softened (but do not wait so long that it has gone fully soft).</li>
        <li>Pour out the boiling water and rice into a sieve again, then add a significant amount of oil to the bottom
            of the pot used for rice (this will make the cooked rice crispy and delicious - called tahdig).</li>
        <li>Put the rice back in the pot and add one cup of water along the of the pot. Put on the lid (wrapped in 
            a towel first) and cook on low heat for 25-30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve the eggplant stew with rice and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

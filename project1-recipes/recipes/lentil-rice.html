    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Lentil Rice is a very common Persian dish that is often cooked at home. It consists of rice mixed with
        lentils, along with other ingredients such as ground beef and/or chicken, various spices, and raisins.
        It is delicious when eaten with yoghurt. Here, we will cook lentil rice with added ground beef.

    <h2>Ingredients (4 portions)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups of white basmati rice</li>
        <li>1 cup of lentils</li>
        <li>300 grams ground beef</li>
        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>turmeric powder</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>pepper</li>
        <li>canola oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cooking Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix 6 teaspoons of salt with 3 cups of white basmati rice and soak in water for at least 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Soak lentils in water for at least 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Chop 1 large onion and fry over some canola oil until they have turned golden.</li>
        <li>Add raw ground beef to the onion and using a spatula, work on separating it into smaller chunks.</li>
        <li>When the beef has turned slightly brown, add 1 teaspoon of turmeric powder, salt, and pepper. Mix.</li>
        <li>Continue cooking beef until it has fully turned brown. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Get a separate pot and fill it with water, put it to boil.</li>
        <li>Pour the rice into a sieve and briefly rinse it, then add boiling water. Wait about 10 minutes until 
            the rice has softened (but do not wait so long that it has gone fully soft).</li>
        <li>Pour out the boiling water and rice into a sieve again, then add a significant amount of oil to the bottom
            of the pot used for rice (this will make the cooked rice crispy and delicious - called tahdig).</li>
        <li>Pour out the lentil into a sieve and rinse, then add to the rice.</li>
        <li>Add the cooked beef to rice, along with one cup of water along the edge of the pot. Put on the lid (wrapped
            in a towel first) and cook on low heat for 25-30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix all the ingredients in the pot and serve. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

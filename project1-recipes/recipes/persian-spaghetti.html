    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Everyone is familiar with spaghetti, but the Persian version has several differences that makes it stand out.
        First the spaghetti itself is on the thicker, shorter side. It it also mixed with tomato paste which turns it
        slightly orange and provides added flavour. It is also mixed with ground beef and oregano. The highlight is 
        spaghetti tahdig which is the slightly burnt, crispy spaghetti flattened at the bottom of the pot after cooking.
